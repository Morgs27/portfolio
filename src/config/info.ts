        I'm Morgan Daniel, a self-taught web developer actively
        pursuing a degree in Computing Science at The University of
        Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>
        My journey into web development began as I sought to improve
        the functionality and visual appeal of a website I used
        frequently. This sparked my interest in the process of
        learning various programming languages and frameworks.
